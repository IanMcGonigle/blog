# This has been a long time comming....

There are many reasons for me to start writing in something like a journal. As I get older my memory does not serve me as well as it used to. Writing down what happened, who was involved, and how I felt about it, will help me forge stronger memories in the first place, as well function as a reference I can look back on in the future.

This is also an opportunity to hone my communication skills. I feel like I often struggle to communicate effectively. I feel that what I say is frequently misunderstood. By attempting to write more frequently, I hope that my overall communication will improve, and I will gain confidence in my ability to effectively communicate ideas.

My initial goal is to write 3 posts per week. Most of these I assume will be journal-esque posts about what my family and I have been up to. Other content may include sounds cloud links to songs the kids and I have made, websites or apps I make, thoughts about books I read, or if I am really feeling bold perhaps an attempted essay or short story.

This fulfills a New Year's resolution that I have for 2025 to create more. I am at my most content when I am creating things. I get lost in the process, swept up in the flow, and end up riding a wave of satisfaction that can last days. I experience this way making music on the computer and with people, and experience it when working on an interesting web projects. People can achieve this flow when writing, although I have not experienced it myself, I have not really tried, and it seems like it would be the activity with the least overhead or set up required, which means that I can attempt to get that feeling more often, and in less time.

This is not for anyone else. This is for me. This is a whetstone on which I can sharpen my skills.
