Tuesday, July 1st was Canada Day. Kari, Grant, Truman and I were able to go to the Blue Jays game. Kari's dad often gets tickets to sporting events, and he generously will offer them to us. So once a year we find ourselves at a Blue Jays game. Last year was Father's Day and this year was Canada Day. The Blue Jays were playing the Yankees, which is always an exciting matchup. Aaron Judge #99 for the Yankees is widely regarded to be one of the best players in the world right now, so we were excited to go see him play.

In the afternoon we took the GO train from Danforth GO to Union Station. This is the by far the most convenient way for us to get downtown and to the sporting events that are at the Sky Dome or Scotiabank Arena. On the train platform, we ran into our neighbors, Katie, Lance and Lyra - all dressed in Blue Jay's gear. Lyra is a precocious 10-year-old who lives across the street. Her birthday is the 3rd of July, the day before Truman's. We saw them on the platform, and immediately the children began to get silly. We arrived at Union Station and took the Skyway, which is an enclosed glass corridor that links Union Station to the UP Express and the CN Tower. That's where we split up with our friends, who were going to a different gate, and we say goodbye.

We entered Gate 8, in the TD lounge area, the seats are on the 200 level and are spectacular. Right behind home plate, an excellent view of the game. Now it's July, so it was hot. Luckily, when we first arrived we were not in direct sunlight, so it was comfortable. Seated in the TD Lounge area, we had dedicated servers to each section, which is nice since we don't have to leave our seats to get food and drink. We saw one of Truman's teachers, Mme. Gerber walking through our section. She works there during the summer. She gave us free popcorn and fuzzy peach snacks.

At the start of the game, there was a lot of Canada Day festivities. They were honoring military personnel, and unfurling a gigantic Canadian flag that covered most of the outfield. Then there was a lot of patriotic video presentations. I always find these a little, unsettling and jingoistic. I think this kind of nationalism the root cause of a lot of problems that humanity faces. Most people seemed excited to participate, I felt apprehensive. I get this way around Remembrance too.

Since it was Canada Day, the Blue Jays forgo their regular blue uniforms, and wore red and white uniforms. They do this every year. And as the only international sports team that operates in Canada during the summer, I guess they are the only ones who have the opportunity to have Canada Day themed attire. If we had decided to show up hours before the game, we could have been given red Canada shirts too.

Eventually the game started. And the Blue Jays were down 2 - 0 after about a dozen pitches. It didn't look like it was going to be a particularly good game for the Blue Jays. After the Yankee's initial burst of runs, the game slowed down. The sun came out and beat down directly on our section of the stadium. People left their seats to go find shade. Truman and I missed an entire inning waiting to refill our water bottles. But then a few innings later. We had a solo home run, And then another by George Springer. At this point the boys had become invested in the outcome of the game.  The people returned to their seats. Not even the scorching sun overhead could keep the crowd from the drama of a close game.

Few innings later and the bases were loaded, and George Springer walked up to the plate. The boys were giddy, standing and jumping. "Get a grand slam!" the boys shouted again and again. And then he delivered: Grand Slam! This put the game out of reach for the Yankees. In the 8th inning, Springer had another opportunity for a grand slam. He hit a two run single, impressive, but nearly as dramatic as the earlier at bat. In the end the Jays won 12 - 5, and the boys were so excited.
