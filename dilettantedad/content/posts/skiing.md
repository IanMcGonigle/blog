# Hitting the Slopes

Today we decided to forgo our regularly scheduled Saturday activities and take the boys skiing. While the Greater-Toronto-Area is not known for its mountainous terrain, there are several small ski hills within an hours drive of the city. We chose to go to a ski park on the Niagara escarpment called Glen Eden in Milton, where I grew up, and where I spent many evening skiing.

The original plan had been that I would have taken Grant, and Truman would have stayed home with Kari. This caused Truman to get very upset. Kari offered to come and so that I would not have to supervise two children on the "mountain", but she was not exactly thrilled with the idea of skiing. She did not grow up skiing, she had been exactly once and never felt in control going down the hill.
To add to her reservations, we had been unable to secure rentals or lessons beforehand. We had been instructed to call Glen Eden the day of our desired outing to see if rentals and lessons would be available. This is the type of non-formalized plan that makes Kari uncomfortable.

We called first thing in the morning, but never spoke to a person. We decided to take our chances and leave for Milton.

The hill had changed a lot in the 20 years or so I had been away. A new set of beginner ski runs to the west of the hill, an additional ski lodge on the western side of the park, a new chairlift to replace the t-bar, and a terrain park for snowboarders. Snowboarding had not even been allowed when I used to frequent Glen Eden. The rental shop had also been moved to a compound of trailers set up in what used to be the main parking lot.

Getting the rental equipment was a laborious process. Two energetic boys with two frustrated parents being served by a couple of disinterested teenagers is a recipe for frustration. Boots were too hard to fasten, helmets were either too big or too small for Truman, they had no ski boots designed for women. Eventually we were all kitted out with skis boots, and helmets, and had secured a private lesson at 12:45. Now laden with our ski rentals, we were told we were parked in the 15-minute-rental-pick-up-only lot and needed to move the car to the new western parking lot down the road. We loaded up the car and headed west.

After fumbling to put on our equipment in the parking lot, we caught the shuttle to the eastern hills and the beginner slopes. I tried to show the boys how to maneuver in their skis, but I am not a good teacher. Grant was able to march around successfully, but Truman got very frustrated and fatalistic about the whole endeavour. Kari decided to wait until the lessons to attempt her skis, and we suggested that Truman do the same. I took Grant up the conveyor belt to the top of the bunny slopes. I told him to make a big pizza shape with his skis to control his speed, and off we went.

Grant went down the hill with no problems at all! His very first time was a huge success! He made the pizza snow plow, he turned, he avoided other people. When I met him at the bottom he said "Let's do that again!" and we did. He was a natural! We were able to squeeze in a few more runs before the start of the lesson.

Kari, Grant and Truman met the instructor at the bottom of the hill.
