# Hitting the Slopes

Today we decided to forgo our regularly scheduled Saturday activities and take the boys skiing. While the Greater-Toronto-Area is not known for its mountainous terrain, there are several small ski hills within an hours drive of the city. We chose to go to a ski park on the Niagara escarpment called Glen Eden in Milton, where I grew up, and where I spent many evenings skiing.

The original plan had been that I would have taken Grant, and Truman would have stayed home with Kari. This caused Truman to get very upset. Kari offered to come and so that I would not have to supervise two children on the "mountain", but she was not exactly thrilled with the idea of skiing. She did not grow up skiing, she had been exactly once and never felt in control going down the hill.
To add to her reservations, we had been unable to secure rentals or lessons beforehand. We had been instructed to call Glen Eden the day of our desired outing to see if rentals and lessons would be available. This is the type of non-formalized plan that makes Kari uncomfortable.

We called first thing in the morning, but never spoke to a person. We decided to take our chances and leave for Milton.

The hill had changed a lot in the 20 years or so I had been away. A new set of beginner ski runs to the west of the hill, an additional ski lodge on the western side of the park, a new chairlift to replace the t-bar, and a terrain park for snowboarders. Snowboarding had not even been allowed when I used to frequent Glen Eden. The rental shop had also been moved to a compound of trailers set up in what used to be the main parking lot.

Getting the rental equipment was a laborious process. Two energetic boys with two frustrated parents being served by a couple of disinterested teenagers is a recipe for frustration. Boots were too hard to fasten, helmets were either too big or too small for Truman, they had no ski boots designed for women. Eventually we were all kitted out with skis boots, and helmets, and had secured a private lesson at 12:45. Now laden with our ski rentals, we were told we were parked in the 15-minute-rental-pick-up-only lot and needed to move the car to the new western parking lot down the road. We loaded up the car and headed west.

After fumbling to put on our equipment in the parking lot, we caught the shuttle to the eastern hills and the beginner slopes. I tried to show the boys how to maneuver in their skis, but I am not a good teacher. Grant was able to march around successfully, but Truman got very frustrated and fatalistic about the whole endeavour. Kari decided to wait until the lessons to attempt her skis, and we suggested that Truman do the same. I took Grant up the conveyor belt to the top of the bunny slopes. I told him to make a big pizza shape with his skis to control his speed, and off we went.

Grant went down the hill with no problems at all! His very first time was a huge success! He made the pizza snow plow, he turned, he avoided other people. When I met him at the bottom he said "Let's do that again!" and we did. He was a natural! We were able to squeeze in a few more runs before the start of the lesson.

Kari, Grant and Truman met the instructor at the bottom of the hill. He took them to the top of the hill and explained the mechanics of turning, making the "Big Pizza" and long curved paths across the hill to control your speed. Then demonstrated, stopping halfway down the hill before calling Grant to come join him. Grant made the snow plow shape, and made off down the hill, making several graceful zigzags across the hill to meet up with the instructor. The instructor called for Truman. Truman readied himself, pointed his skis inwards and took straight down the slope! I raced to the bottom to check on him. At the bottom he turned to me and with a wide grin said "Skiing is so much fun!"

The lesson continued for an hour and involved adding some upper body movements to help with weight distributing for turns. They were able to get a dozen runs down the bunny slope in their lesson. The boys had a great time. The instructor was very impressed with them both. "I can't believe this is your first time skiing!" he said "Grant I think you are ready to try one of the bigger hills."
Grant was certain that he was some sort of skiing prodigy and wanted to conquer the rest of the runs at Glen Eden.

After a quick lunch we split up: Mom and Truman went back to the bunny slopes, and Grant and I to take on the larger hills. Grant and I took a chairlift from the lunch area to the western runs. This was a new chairlift, and the longest one at the park. Grant marveled at how high we seemed when looking back towards the road, but how we weren't really that high off the ground. Grant got off the chairlift without much trouble, but fell while trying to clear the path for the next set of riders. When we reached the top of the intermediate hill known as Twister, I could tell he was frustrated about the fall. "Everyone falls at some point getting off the chairlift." I told him, but it was clear his confidence was eroding. We waited for a number of other people to start their decent, so that we could have a clear run. Grant was making the snow plow shape, making his tuns and doing a great job! About a third of the way down the hill Grant began to lose control, and fell near the edge of the forest lining the run. I stopped to help him up. "I've lost all my skiing ability!" Grant shouted dramatically. 

"No you haven't. This is your first time skiing, everyone falls their first time skiing." I reassured him. But he became more sure that he at one time had talent, but now he had lost it, despite this being his first time one skis.

"I am never skiing again!" he shouted, "I want to stop now!"

"We need to ski to get _off_ the hill." I said, my impatience creeping into my voice.

Working together we got him back onto his skis and headed down the hill.

This scene was repeated three more times before we hit the bottom of the run. Each time the mutual frustration ratcheted up.

I was able to convince Grant to take another stab at the hill. "You have fallen at the tricky parts and know where they are." I said. I told him that he did a fantastic job. Falling is part of skiing, and it is normal for people to fall, especially on their first day. He really had been doing great. He perhaps a little overconfident, but really the only thing he needed to improve was his attitude. I felt guilty about getting frustrated with him. 

Grant took a tumble at top of the chairlift on our second attempt at Twister. His skis crossed, and he fell awkwardly in the path of the chairlift. A ski patrol grabbed him and lifted him out of the way before I could make it to help. Grant was terribly upset. He had twisted his knee and ankle and was sobbing softly.

"I never want to ski again! I want to stop NOW!" he said. His frustration was fever pitched, as was mine.

"We need to ski to get _off_ the hill. And then we will go home, and I will _NEVER_ take you skiing again" I snapped at him.

We descended Twister again, and it was a carbon copy of the previous run. By the bottom we had both had enough. I wish I had not gotten so frustrated and angry. He really had been doing great.
I should have been more supportive. We took off our skis and marched towards the East Lodge, near the rental shop.

We met up with Kari and Truman at the rental office. "We've been having a great time!" Truman declared. Kari had been coaching Truman through exercises they learned in their lessons. He had been perfecting his long wide curves, pizza plowing, and helicopter arms. I am not sure _if_ Kari had been having a great time, but I am sure she had enjoyed Truman's enjoyment.
Grant told Kari and Truman that we were going home. Truman cried out "Nooooooooooo!"

Kari went into therapy-mom mode and began to calm Grant down. Eventually she was able to convince Grant that having another go at the bunny slopes would help him regain his confidence, and let him leave on a high note. Mommy magic.

We stayed for another hour before it started to get dark. We had many successful runs down the bunny hills. Although Grant fell on his final run, and we left Glen Eden in generally high spirits.
I am very proud of Kari, grant and Truman. They all outperformed my expectations, even if they didn't outperform their own.

To lighten the mood on the car ride home, I sent Grant some text messages "Audiooooooooooooo" quoting the Justice song we were listening to Audio, Video Disco.

In return, he sent me gibberish, which then the car read out loud in its robotic voice. This made everyone in the car belly laugh. For the remainder of the trip home the boys continued sending me text messages for the car to read. Messages about poo, and poop shoes, and other nonsense were dutifully read by the car to the boys delight.

After a quick dinner of hamburgers from Rudy's the boys were tuckered out and ready for bed. Despite some moments of frustration, the ski trip was a success.
