# A Week in Tobermory

Way back in February, Kari had booked us a cottage in Tobermory for the week of the August long weekend. In February, this seemed like a lifetime away. But the pace of life is unrelenting, and the approaching vacation snuck up on Kari and I.

On the Wednesday before the vacation, we realized we had no plans for kayaks. We have had two cottage experience, and kayaking had been a favored passed time each time. The first cottage kayaks were supplied. At the second we rented them. The cost of renting two kayaks for the week was considerable, and we debated the cost of purchasing our own. So, on the Wednesday evening decided to buy our own. This gave us two days. On Thursday and Friday we scrambled to buy life jackets, paddles and kayaks, and a means to mount them on our car.
After much running around we were proud owners of two kayaks.

Saturday morning we strapped our brand-new kayaks to our brand-new roof racks, and set off on the four-hour-plus drive up to Tobermory. We listened to an audiobook along the way "The Twits Next Door" a book inspired by Roald Dahl's novel "The Twits". We stopped in Owen sound to have a late lunch and stretch our legs. Approaching Tobermory, we were running low on gas. We had not seen an operational gas station in a while. We had been warned that past Wiarton, there might not be any opportunities to fuel up. We left home with a full tank, and our Prius never needs to re-fuel during a road trip. Our anxiety mounted with each passing kilometer.

We were finally able to get gas, about fifteen minutes away from our rental cottage. It was a full service station, the attendant gave the boys lollipops. Kari and I were both visibly relieved.

Our cottage, like everything else in Tobermory, was just off Highway 6. Take Dorcas Bay Road, past Singing Sands Beach, for a ten-minute spiraling jaunt, then turn on to Robert Allen Drive for what seemed like the same drive we had just taken on Dorcas Bay Road. The trees on this part of the Bruce Peninsula were far from majestic. It looked like a Christmas tree farm that had been abandoned thirty years before. All the trees seemed evenly spaced, of a uniform height and shorter than they should have been. Each driveway had a bear-proof metal box for their garbage.

Our cottage was on [Little Eagle Harbor](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Little+Eagle+Harbour/@45.1526611,-81.582768,15.08z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4d2d0fe7fd430fe1:0x13ab60f484f0ae4d!8m2!3d45.1487673!4d-81.580432!16s%2Fg%2F1tj1rqdq?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgxMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). The original house was a one and a half story building with red siding, with two bedrooms up-stairs, a laundry room, a large dining room, a kitchen, and a third bedroom tucked in under the stairs. The addition had beige siding and was called the Great Room. It had a peaked ceiling that matched the pitch and slope of the original house, a wood burning stove in one corner, a TV a comfy chair, a leather couch and a matching loveseat. The floor around the edge was hardwood, like the rest of the cottage, but had a carpet installed in a recess in the floor of the great room. The great room had windows on all the exterior walls.

The cottage's eastern facing walls were mostly windows facing the water. Outside there was a two level deck with a grill on the upper deck, and a seating area on the lower deck. There were two natural paths moving away from the deck. On the right-hand side there was a fire-pit area with Muskoka chairs circling an iron meshed fire pit. To the left a stone lined natural path to small a three tiered dock/deck that looked out over section of the rocky beach of Little Eagle Harbor.

We had no activities planned for the first few days we were there. Relaxing was the only agenda item. We spent much of this time taking turns kayaking around the harbor, and swimming by the dock of our cottage. The water was quite cold, as are most of the great lakes, but unlike the other great lakes I have been to the water was glassy and transparent. The water took on shades of blue that were almost turquoise. You could see the carpet of knife-like rocks at every depth across the harbor. The shore was covered in similarly jagged rocks. Every step I took was precarious. The rocks were so uneven and sharp that every foot fall threatened a twisted ankle or a fall. Grant and Truman however seemed to prance about the rocks with the grace and speed of gazelles on the African plains.

We swam. We kayaked. We read our books. The boys climbed a tree in the yard. We had s'mores at the fire pit. We relaxed. The boys were bored by day two.

The boys found K-pop Demon Hunters on Netflix, and this became their soundtrack, and overarching focus during the trip.

We had several national parks we had planned to see while on the Bruce Peninsula. The first was called ["The Grotto"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/the+grotto+bruce+peninsula+national+park/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2d062bec46ad1b:0xec9dc7da5d7ccc24?sa=X&ved=1t:155783&ictx=111). The Grotto is very popular and will only allow a certain number of people in at a time. This means timed entry and exit for all visitors. We went in the morning and needed to leave by 1 pm. We followed a pleasant and easy hiking trail leading to the Grotto. The trail seemed to get less easy as we went along. The trail took us to Indian Head Cove. The water here was a shade I had never thought possible in Canada. It looked like the waters in Dubrovnik. Bright turquoise and blue water, crashing waves, and beach of large round rocks of pure white lime stone. We looked around for a few minutes before climbing the trail marked "Difficult" that lead to the Grotto.

This "trail" was really more of a trail in spirit. White way-points painted on trees, and a rough rocky terrain that had me on all fours more than once. The Grotto was a cave and a cliff that looked like the cave beach from our trip to Croatia. It was very impressive. It was also very crowded, and the people gathered had little room to maneuver. It was like a crowded subway platform, but instead of falling onto the track, you could fall down 60 feet of razor edged rocks into a scenic ocean cave.

We headed back to swim at Indian Head Cove. We set up shop on a big rock next to a little cove where the waves were crashing in a fun but manageable way. The water was iridescent blue at a distance and crystal clear up close. The smooth white limestone shelves on the floor of the cove gave the whole scene the appearance of water melt on a glacier. The water felt as cold as glacier run off. The water was colder than any beach we had been to except for Long beach in Tofino. The boys and I all played in the surf. Excited by the smoothness of the lime stone underfoot and the clarity of the water. Kari sat on in the sun on the rock overlooking us. Besides the little inlet where we were playing, there were two more to the left, each separated by an outcropping of rock. The waves got progressively more intense moving to the left.

The boys got cold and headed up to the rock to sit with Kari and have a snack. I explored the other inlets. I found at the inlet furthest from our perch there was a space to jump off the rocks safely. I did this several times. It was fascinating to see the contour of the limestone beach under the water. Seeing shelves and cliffs, and large smooth stones. Kari, Grant, and Truman all came into the water. Kari and Grant found it too cold and went back to sit on the large rock. But "We _ALL_ went swimming" as Kari likes to say. Truman and I played in the water for a while longer. Kari said that I was having the time of my life. It may have been my favorite beach of all time.

The next day we drove into Tobermory for to take a glass-bottomed boat tour with a stop off at [Flowerpot Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowerpot_Island). The boat was crowded, but the boys and I were able to secure space near the glass floor of the boat. The frigid temperature of the water plus its remarkable clarity resulted in pristine views of well-preserved wooden ships that sank long ago.

Approaching Flower Pot Island, we could see the islands eponymous stone formations. At this point the waves got particularly heavy and scared Truman. Kari took him inside and soothed him. The boat deposited us at the start of a hiking trail. We took the trail which was just set back from the coast. Every so often we would break from the trail to admire the beaches that were made from large sheets of smooth unbroken rock. There were many of these beaches along the trail, and we stopped to wade in up to our ankles at most of them.

Eventually we saw the smaller of the two "Flower Pots" from the trail. We climbed down a small rocky slope to get a better look. The smaller flowerpot sat on a mound of rock with a flat top, almost like a pedestal. Truman asked if humans had made them because of how uniformed the structure looked. The boys ran around the small pot and the stony beach it flanked. They broke out Truman's walkie-talkies and had a great time making noises at each other at a distance.

We continued on the trail to the larger flowerpot. The rocky slope to this one seemed more precarious, but it was worth it. The rocky sea stack seemed to sprout straight from the water. Standing stoically in the crashing waves. Unfortunately we were not able to admire the large pot for longer as there was limited space and lots of people trying to get their Instagram pics. We returned to the trail and eventually found a beach that looked to be made of white limestone spheres. It looked like a beach made of softballs, with unnaturally blue water. It did not look like Canada. We got into the water and realized that we needed to be back at the boat pickup in forty minutes. The boys and I sat in the surf and played for twenty minutes before retracing our path back to the boat.

Later that evening Kari and I thought that we would watch a movie with the boys. Anything but Kpop Demon Hunter's which the boys had now watched twice a day since arriving at the cottage. We decided on the Jim Carrey classic The Truman Show. This was a mistake. Both boys decided instead of watching the movie, they would launch a never ending barrage of questions about everything that popped up on the screen. "Is he a bad guy? Why is he weird? Is he famous? Do people know he is famous? Does he know he is famous? Does he die? Why doesn't he know he is famous? He is very weird. Do other people think he is weird? Are you sure he doesn't die? Did this happen in real life? Are you sure it didn't happen?" While these are all legitimate questions, their frequency drowned out all the dialogue and any chance of having them answered organically by watching the film.

The following morning we went to [Singing Sands Beach](https://brucegreysimcoe.com/operators/singing-sands-beach). We knew we needed to go early because the parking lot was small and filled quickly. We passed the entrance every time we left or returned to the cottage. The lot was often full when on our first pass of the day. It was our only sandy beach visit of the week. The sand seemed to stretch out forever before reaching the water. The water itself was clear (of course) warm, and very shallow. The boys and I set off to explore the water. We must have walked about five hundred meters from shore before the water was above my waist. We turned and decided to play in the shallows by the water's edge. I described the walk back to shore like drudging through large snow drifts after a record snowfall - except the snow was melted. Kari did not understand. The boys decided to dig a hole and busied themselves far a while. Kari walked out to the waist deep water. When she got back she understood what I had been talking about.

In the afternoon we went to [Halfway Log Dump](https://share.google/L9ZjgRoBs85RSK5PJ). Located on the other side of the peninsula, and we needed to drive twenty minutes down an extraordinarily dusty road. By the time we parked the car it was covered in a layer of fine dust that was a couple of centimeters thick in certain spots. After a short hike we came to a clearing and made our way down to the beach. It stretched for hundreds of meters out to each side. The shore was made up of softball like stones, like the ones on Flowerpot Island, but was a steep incline down to the water. The water was other worldly. Blue, turquoise and clear. It was a similar temperature to Indian Head Cove, but with more consistently gentle waves. The water was deep, and the floor was made up of large lime stone rocks, not a shelf like other places. The boys needed to move from stone to stone to keep their heads above water. They took to naming the various rocks that they could stand on. Fish Rock, Starting Rock, Family Rock were some of my favorites. On shore, Kari started to notice flies. The flies bit, and they bit hard. Kari braved the cold water to escape the flies.

After a while at our first location on the beach we decided to try another section that had some rocky shelves. The walk there was an assault by the flies. No one was spared. This other section of the beach was a lot of fun. The rock shelf beach was a great place to sit and get hit by the waves. The water along the main rock was about three feet deep, but then there was a steep drop off at the rocks edge. We noticed that unlike all the other beaches we had visited during the week, there was nobody lounging on the shore. Anyone who was here was in the water. And when they left the water, they left the beach.

When we left we ran trying to escape unbitten. The flies rode on our backs, and bags and towels. When we got to the car we made our best efforts not to track the flies in. A lone soldier made it into the car, but I was able to swat it before it could bite anyone.

After the beach we watched Spaceballs with the boys. There were far fewer questions about it than there were for the Truman Show.

Our last full day at the cottage was the Friday, and we received our first poor weather of the week. We spent Friday reading, playing computer games, and watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. While it was unfortunate that we couldn't enjoy the water we enjoyed a relaxing day. Kari even made s'mores in the oven - they were a smashing success.

On Saturday, we packed up our things and headed home. We listened to a Hardy Boys audiobook and the Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack on the way home. It was a successful vacation, but I was happy to be home and sleep in my own bed.
