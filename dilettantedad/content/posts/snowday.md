# Team Brothers: Snow Day

In a week that would normally have been dominated by Valentine's Day and a P.A. day on Friday, our schedule was upended by the largest single snow fall we have had in years. The snow started on Wednesday afternoon, and did not stop until Thursday morning. The first casualty was Grant's Wednesday evening soccer practice. Next was school on Thursday, and finally Kari's office closed too.

The boys were ecstatic! Snow day plus P.A. day plus Family Day on Monday equals FIVE-DAY WEEKEND! They immediately set out on an urgent and unprescribed task: Draw and document as many dinosaurs as possible. They will often make up tasks like this, and execute them as a team. Kari and I call these "Team Brothers" moments. Fully occupied by the sweetest little tasks it is a joy to watch them go.

This time Team Brothers decided to collate their dino drawings into a book, and books are serious business. They were focused on the task at hand, and had exceedingly high standards set for the book. The basement took on frantic the air of newsroom floor, tasks shouted, paper flying, work was getting done. Every so often when a drawing was deemed complete the artist would show us their work, and give a detailed analysis of their technique. Sometimes when the artist was finished, they decided that the quality of the rendering was not up to snuff, they would break down sobbing and would need consoling.

On Thursday afternoon, to give the boys a break from dino-publishing—and to clear the house for the cleaner—Kari took them sledding at East-Lynn Park. The boys had already been sledding once this week, just a day after our ski trip on Sunday. I had taken the P.A. day off work, and had planned to take the boys sledding with the GT Snow racer on Friday. Watching the boys sledding is such fun! They are all smiles and giggles. Team Brothers is often in full effect on the toboggan hill as they will assign arbitrary and imaginary properties to certain runs down the hill. I wished I could have gone, but I had a soft launch of a feature at work, and it was newly crashing.

A few hours later they returned from the hill and Team Brothers took to lurching around the 25 cm of new snow in the backyard. I was happy I got to watch this from the kitchen windows as I made some homemade chicken noodle soup for dinner.

On Friday I suggested we go to see the Dog Man movie instead going sledding again. They agreed they could take the time away from their book to see the movie. We went to Harvey's for lunch before the showtime. At the theater, we were told that the tickets we had were for a theater in Mississauga. The ticket taker said the show had started, but claimed we were _only_ 15 minutes late. I got mad, and lost my cool. I need to be a better role model for the boys. We went into the theater, the movie was clearly further along than the attendant had let on. While the boys enjoyed the portion of the movie we saw, they both said they wished we had seen the whole thing. I felt the same way and got visibly upset, and angry, it upset the boys, and we went home, all of us in a bad mood. I felt like such a failure as a parent. Darlings like Team Brothers deserve better parenting than I can provide.

At home the boys went right back to their dinosaur drawings, and I started to make Mediterranean chicken for dinner as a Valentines present for Kari. When she returned I told her about my parenting-fail. She agreed that I need to work on controlling my reaction to disappointment in front of the boys, but assured me that they would be fine and would bounce back from the situation at the movies. When we called them up for dinner, they were chattering about various dinosaurs and comparing their features. They were as happy as can be, not even a terrible outing with Dad can sap the joy from Team Brothers!

 Watching Team Brothers in action is almost too sweet to bear, knowing that it won't last makes it feel like my heart is being crushed in a vice. Anticipating the absence of something so good and pure makes me intolerably sad. It forces me to remember Kurt Vonnegut's advice: to pause in moments like these and say, 'Well, if this isn’t nice, I don’t know what is.'"
