# Fun filled Week in July

This week was busy but fun. On Wednesday, July 9 Kari, Grant, Truman, and I all took the GO train out to Exhibition to see Weird Al Yankovic at Budweiser Gardens. It was the boys' first concert. They were excited, but apprehensive. I was a little concerned as it started to rain, but what is an outdoor concert without a little rain. We followed the crowd of people through the parking lot for BMO field, over the foot bridge that crosses Lakeshore blvd to the grounds of Budweiser Gardens. As we approached the gates I saw a familiar face - Kari's cousin's husband Ricky. I shouted "Ricky, Ricky" into the crowd. He turned and said 'Not Ricky, Andy. Do I know you?". Ricky has a twin named Andy. We told him how we knew Ricky, and we went off to our respective seats.

The opening act was a 6'8" operatic clown named 'Puddles Pitty Party'. He performed to backing tracks and video projections. He would also bring people from the crowd to "play" cardboard instruments. Over the course of his set it became clear the video projections all had a Kevin Costner theme. Scenes from the Bodyguard, The Postman, paintings of baseball diamonds in cornfields. My favorite moment was when the backing track was Stairway to Heaven while he sang the theme from Gilligan's Island with a montage from Water world playing on the screens. His final number was a rendition of _My Heart Will Go On_ with words adapted to profess his love of Kevin Costner. He gradually morphed the Celine Dion classic into _One_ by Metallica. It was absurd. It was not for everyone. I loved it.

 After a short intermission, Weird Al took the stage around 9 pm. The show began with _Tacky_ - a parody of Happy by Pharrell Williams. The band was playing on stage - without AL. Al was wandering through the premises and visible on the large video screens that flanked the stage. He greeted fans while singing and dancing. Truman was so excited. He was bouncing up and down trying to find Al. Both boys had huge smiles on their faces and bopped along with every tune. It is clear Al and co. have been at this a long time. There were no lulls or low energy segments in the show. They band made several costume changes to match the attire of the various music videos. They dressed like Devo for Dare to Be Stupid, like Nirvana for Smells Like Nirvana and as Amish for the Gangster's Paradise parody. During the costume changes, there would be clips from Al TV - funny edits of celebrity interviews - or sometimes clips from UHF or other Al movies. The most memorable clip was a cameo-laden scene from the Weird Al biopic starring Daniel Radcliffe. The scene was a fictitious telling of how AL came to create 'Another One Rides the Bus'.

About halfway through the show Al performed an eleven song medley of some of his most popular songs. What a treat! The boys were bouncing and singing, and trying to figure out what song would come next. This medley had its won costume changes throughout the song. Going from CIA, to Michael Jackson to a surgeon, and. It may be the most impressive live performance I have seen.

At this point I wondered if the boys would still have energy, it was late, and they had been at camp all day. But their enthusiasm never waned. Even through some of the unfamiliar numbers in the second half of the set, their energy remained high.

After Amish Paradise, Al introduced the band, and said goodnight. The boys were confused. 'Are they done?' they kept asking. The crowd chanted for an encore.

Al and the band came out dressed as Star Wars characters, along with a dozen or so storm-trooper-dancers. The boys and I decided that they were going to play The Saga Begins - Al's recounting the plot of the Phantom Menace to the tune of American Pie by Don McLean. Instead, he sang a song that was a riff on an Al TV interview with Michael Stipe of REM called 'We All Have Cell Phones'. The boys laughed so hard at this call back. It was an inside joke that they were a part of. They loved it!

The next song was The Saga Begins, and it was a crowd pleaser. Everyone sang along. The storm troopers danced and acted out certain scenes. Like American Pie, it is a long song, but it was over before I knew it. The crowd erupted. I was really hoping that it was not over. There was a long pause for cheers to die down. And the band leapt into Yoda. Lola is one of my favorite songs, and this was such a great way to end the set.

The boys sang Weird Al songs all the way home. Grant said it was so much better than he had even hoped. Truman said: It was an experience I will always remember. Mission accomplished.

On Saturday, July 13 we went to Innisfil to see Kari's cousin's family. We told Ricky about seeing his twin brother at the Weird Al concert. The boys played with their second cousin Ozzie while the adults tried to stay in the shade of the tree in their backyard. The whole King family came to enjoy some hot dogs, company, and the nearby beach - Cook's Bay on lake Simcoe.

It was very hot and the water was very warm - for a lake in Ontario. We had great fun splashing at the water's edge for a while. Wendy and Brian brought a motorboat and four kayaks for everyone to enjoy. Kari, Pam, and Steve all took out kayaks, while Brian and Wendy took people tubing with the motorboat. A wonderful time was had by everyone.

Sunday the 14th appears to be one of our only unscheduled days of the summer. We took the opportunity to laze around the house. Grant and I watched the FIFA Club World Cup final between PSG and Chelsea. Chelsea won 3 - 0, in a surprise upset.

Truman and I made a song. I made a drum beat. Truman made a melody with a xylophone patch. And I tried to make something that worked underneath. Truman wants to come back and add a guitar solo. I am not sure if he will remember. I called it _Sunday Vibes_ and posted it on Soundcloud.
