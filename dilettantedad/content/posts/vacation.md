# Vacation on the Adriatic Sea

On Friday May 16th we embarked on a family trip to Italy and Croatia. This is a trip Kari and I had been mulling over since before the boys were born. The plan: To fly to Venice - spend a few days there, then take a ferry across the Adriatic to Croatia, and spend a week on the Dalmatian coast.

The flight was delayed and long, but direct from Toronto to Venice. We sat two by two Kari with Grant, myself and Truman the row behind them. We were fortunate that we all got some sleep.

## Venice
### Day 1
We arrived in Venice around noon local time, and were greeted by an older Italian woman with a placard with Kari's name on it. We hopped in a large black van and headed from Marco Polo airport across the Constitution bridge to the edge of the city. The sun was high and the sky clear, it was warm. We soaked up the sunshine while we waited for the first of many boats on the trip - a water taxi to The Saturnia - our hotel while in Venice.

We took the taxi through the canals of Venice, passing gondolas full of tourists, under low foot bridges, and passed all manner of Italian style buildings all bordered with salt stains from high waters past. We took the grand canal for a while and past water busses and speed boats, before turning down another small canal on which our hotel had an entrance.

We met our concierge at the hotel, a Venetian local, who marked several points of interest on a map, and gave us our room key. The key was a card, and a physical key all on a long thin metal key chain that looked like a miniature abacus. Our room was a large suite on the second floor. It had a queen bed on the ground level, two bathrooms a mezzanine with two twin beds for the boys. After settling in we decided to explore the city, and look for gelato and maybe food.

We wandered the city looking for some lunch. We were unable to follow the markings the concierge had left on our map, but found a sandwich shop. The concierge gave us a useful tip for way finding - Look up and there will be signs with arrows labeled 'Rialto', 'Accadamia', or 'San Marco'. Using this system we wandered through the narrow streets of stuccoed buildings to Saint Marks Square. The square was very impressive, full of people and pigeons. The boys had room to run around, and we were able slowly make our way from an arcade on one side of the square to the other where the Basilica, Doge's Palace, and Saint Marks Tower could be found.

The arcades around the square were full of restaurants and high-end shops, and exits to various side streets. After marveling at the square we decided to follow the Rialto signs. 

The Rialto bridge was quite the sight. Lined with businesses on either side (there was a tie shop, who buys a silk tie from a tourist trap on a bridge?), spanning the grand canal, full of aspiring Instagram models fighting for space for the perfect shot. At the apex of the bridge there is a gap in the shops on either side, where you can see out. We were treated to terrific views of the grand canal from both sides of the bridge.

We crossed the bridge, ate gelato, had "Take-away" Aperol spritzes and listened to a street performer before continuing our exploration. The city was beautiful, and reminded me of Florence, but with more tourist nick-knack stores - I didn't think that was possible. Everywhere we went the predominant language I heard was English and I could not help feeling bad for the Venetians. They had been a prominent force in global trade and the preeminent naval operation in the Adriatic. The unique properties of the city that had enabled it to become prosperous were a hindrance when the world changed. Now the only business that seemed to exist was parading the city's unique features out for hordes of visitors. Once a regional superpower, now a curiosity to be observed like a freak show at the county fair.

We took a thirty minute ride in a gondola through the winding narrow canals. The gondolas were all black lacquer some had red piping for trim, they reminded me of the Bat-mobile from the 1960's tv show with Adam West. The seating was different than I had imagined - there was a kind of bench seat built into the boat itself, but additional seats were just chairs sitting in the hull, as if they were cargo heading to your grandmother's dining room.

We passed countless other gondoliers along the way. All with gondolas filled with tourists. I had been expecting the gondoliers to sing. But instead, they all seemed to yell at each other. The yelling wasn't mean spirited, but jovial, and happened almost as soon as they spied one another.

We took the labyrinthian canals out to the grand canal - where all the side canals seem to end. We were unable to go out on the grand canal as it was too windy, but we did get out and turn around before heading down another smaller one. After the ride we decided to get some dinner.

We ate dinner along alfresco along a canal. We met a couple of other Canadians at the restaurant. They were from the west coast, and we talked about the NHL playoffs among other things. The food was _ok_, and very expensive - a description that could fit most of the meals we ate in Venice. Grant was pooped on by either a seagull or a pigeon. Either way he was not happy.

After dinner, we took to the narrow streets in search of more gelato. The boys were rambunctious and running up and down the stair on the various foot bridges over the canals. They were having a wonderful time, but I was sure they were going to hurt themselves. I warned them but they did not seem to care. Eventually one of them _did_ fall and scrape their knee. I got angry. I yelled at the boys, it upset them, and Kari. After my outburst the boys said that they did not deserve to be on vacation. I felt terrible. It was not my intention to make them feel this way, but that was the result. I just wanted them to be aware of themselves and their surroundings. I tried to reassure them that it would not be a worthwhile vacation without them.

The city seemed to empty out after dark. We made our way back to our hotel, and the route seemed deserted compared to earlier.

### Day 2
The second day in Venice started with a breakfast buffet in our hotel. We arrived closer to the end of service, so we were seated in auxiliary seating set up in the courtyard that serves as a fancy restaurant in the evening. The spread was great, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, pastries, freshly squeezed juice.

After breakfast we decided to use the spa in the hotel before setting out for the day. We changed into our swim wear and were met with a bellman who lead us to an elevator to the spa level. Now, I am terrified of elevators and try to avoid them at all cost. I asked if there was another way to the span, and was told there was not. This lift was about eight square feet in total, with a low ceiling. Every surface was mirrored. It was slow, we only needed to descend one floor, but it felt like it took an hour. My hear felt like it was going to explode.

The spa itself was lovely. Tiled in emerald green, small but efficient, tucked away beside the gym. We sat in the hot tub and had a good time, for the most part. I tried to relax but I could not stop fretting over our need to return to our floor in the mirrored coffin that brought us here. When it was time to return to the room, Kari and the boys took the elevator, and I found a way out to the courtyard where we ate breakfast, and from there I found my way back to our room.

We went out to explore and decided to see the Academia bridge. It was a wooden bridge that was a lot larger than I had anticipated. We marveled at it for a while and admired the views of the large canal. We crossed over to a new area of the city with no agenda other than finding some gelato. We passed a man playing music on a case full of water glasses. This blew the boys mind and they gave hie a few euros.
We found a gelato kiosk in a secluded courtyard. Near the center of the courtyard was a small public fountain. I think it was bronze, and had a lion's head where the water dribbled out into a bucket on the ground. Truman played with the water at length, and eventually caught the water in his hands declaring loudly "I'm the bucket now!"

We wandered unto we came to a large white church across a bay from St Marks square. There were large steps that extended down to the water. There many people seated on the stairs, many of them painting - I think they may have been taking a class. We went into the church to take a look around. I always get an odd feeling being in these churches. On one hand, they are an a testament to the wondrous things humans can accomplish when they share a common inspiration. And on the other they are monuments to a religious order that has manipulated, oppressed, abused and subjugated countless people for thousands of years.

We took a boat bus from the front of the church one stop to St Marks Square. We had lunch at a restaurant facing the water. The food was expensive, and not that good. While in the washroom, a pigeon landed on Grant's pizza. It would not leave until Kari swatted it. After this the staff gave Truman a squirt bottle and a mission: chase the pigeons away with the water. Truman spent the rest of our time at the restaurant dodging between tables startling pigeons and patrons alike.

After lunch we went to the top of St. Marks tower. The views were nothing short of spectacular. Each cardinal co-ordinate had its own lookout, looking out over the city, the basilica, the lagoon, and the square. The boys kept us up at the top for more than forty five minutes, playing complicated games of eye-spy. I didn't mind, there was a cool breeze and the crowd was small.

Next up was a guided tour of the Doge's Palace. Our guide showed us the most interesting aspects of the palace. The gilded ceilings, the chambers where the laws were written and carried out. One of the most amazing things was the large room. It was decorated with pictures of all the Doges high up in a band where the walls met the ceiling. For a time it was the largest room in the world without any support pillars. We then crossed through The Bridge of Sighs from the Palace to the prison. It was called this by Lord Byron who said prisoners sighed as the looked out the windows on the bridge as this was their last look of freedom. The prison was stark. THe cells were small concrete holes, barred with a special braided steel that was impossible to saw through. The doors into the cells were designed so you can only enter on your knees. The prison had been in operation until the nineteen twenties.

The courtyard at the side of our hotel turns into a posh restaurant in the evenings. White table clothes, multiple forks, a dedicated sommelier. The establishment was probably a little too fancy to bring kids as young as as ours, but they were well behaved, for the most part. The food was the best _I_ had in Venice, but Truman did not like his pasta and did not eat any. I don't think Kari liked her ravioli much either. After dinner we went in search of something more to Truman's liking - pizza - and of course some gelato.

### Day 3
Our last day in Venice we took the Green Line tour of the islands in the Venetian lagoon. We the boat had a tour guide who offered a tour services in English, French, Italian, and German. She was difficult to hear over the roar of the boat engines.

The first Island on the tour was Merano. Where we saw a demonstration of the glassworks the island is famous for. The people gathered in a standing area with tiered steps, like a mini auditorium. We watched as the glassworker make a vase by blowing glass, and then his mentor made a prancing horse out of a molten blob glass. At the end of each demonstration the emcee placed a strip of paper on the finished product and each time it vanished in a burst of flames. After We toured the gift shop, and took a stroll down the main canal before setting off to the next island - Torcello.

There was not much on Torcello. It was the first inhabited island on in the lagoon. There was an old church, as well as numerous restaurants. We had lunch at an outdoor snack-bar next to a playground were the boys could get out some energy.

Our final island was Berano. I wish we could have spent more than an hour there. The island was full of brightly colored houses in tightly packed neighborhoods. The island was traditionally home to a fishing village, and the legend is that the houses were painted vibrantly so that fishermen returning home could distinguish their houses in the dense fog that frequently engulfs the village. We walked the main canals and went down several side streets and allies. The main canals were lined with restaurants and tourist stores, but just off the canals it the buildings seemed to be homes of people who live there full time. Several establishments had sheets hanging in front of the doors. I assumed this was to prevent random tourists from entering.

We returned to the hotel, and waited for a water taxi to take us to the ferry terminal. During our wait we spoke to some people from Rhode Island who had come to Venice as the last stop on a trans Atlantic cruise.

Our lasts views of Venice were very similar to our first - a water taxi on the canals. The taxi was expensive, but worth it as it would have been difficult to get our luggage to the ferry terminal without the taxi.

The sun deck on the ferry was only available while we were in the Venetian lagoon, Grant and I made the most of it. The majority of the trip across the Adriatic we read our respective books.

We arrived in Rovinj to a spectacular sunset. The dock was just outside the old city, and we had great views of the city and the islands just off the coast. The boys looked at the old city and said "IT LOOKS JUST LIKE VENICE". We were met by Damir, our driver for the Croatian portion of our trip. He took us in a big black van and we drove away from Rovinj to an agro-tourismo winery called San Tomasso. This was further from the city than we had anticipated.

Upon arrival we were greeted by what appeared to be the sole person working at the hotel. We had a late dinner, and settled in to a very small but well appointed suite.

#### Pula
Breakfast at San Tomasso was a spectacular spread, a buffet just for us really. Home made yogurt, assorted meats, baked goods the works. Domir picked us up to take us to our first of two guided tours of the day. The first tour was of the city of Pula.

Pula had been established by the ancient romans, and was the home to a roman amphitheater. We picked up our tour guide Sasha, at a gas station that was build into a retaining wall. She immediately won over our boys by asking them what their favorite dinosaurs were. We were not permitted to enter the amphitheater as they were shooting a commercial. At first I was disappointed, but the commercial had roman centurions racing on chariots, so kinda had an authentic amphitheater experience. Sasha gave us the history of the structure, and was impressed by Grant's Croatian he had learned before the trip.

Pula was fascinating as it was obviously a modern working city, but it was peppered with ancient ruins. It was like seeing your teacher at the grocery store times a thousand. Sasha showed us one block that had the entire history of the city: Roman gate, next to Italian Fascist building, next to an Austrian building, next to a communist building. She also introduced us to Burek, a kind of pastry similar to spanakopita, made with phyllo pastry with meat or cheese filling.

#### Rovinj
After Pula, Domir took us to Rovinj. During our van rides I had noticed political signs. The signs all featured a picture of the candidate and their name. I couldn't tell if they were affiliated with any party. I decided that they looked like candidates for an imaginary called "Croatia's Next Top Dracula". For the rest of the trip I was on the lookout for new Dracula candidates.

In Rovinj, we met our tour guide Goran. Goran was very pleasant, and knew much about Canada. He asked us some questions about our provinces that I think were to tell if we were Americans trying to pass as Canadians. "What does 'Nouvelle Ecosse' mean?" he asked when he learned the boys spoke french. He recounted the differences he noted between anglophones from different provinces. While he made fun of their accent, he declared his appreciation of the Quebecois, saying they were far less stuffy and formal than the French.

Both our tour guides had been charmed and impressed with the boy's french, and Grant's pronunciation of a few dozen Croatian words.

Rovinj's old city is pedestrian only so we spent our time exploring on foot. Goran Told us that the city initially was an island, separated by a narrow channel. The island was one large hill with a church located at the summit. On the island, all the houses and buildings had been built out to the water's edge. Eventually the channel was filled in, and allowed the city to expand onto the mainland. Many buildings on the peninsula seemed to have doors leading to nowhere except the water. Goran told us this was to allow ships to pull up and load. These doors had at various times been unofficial ports for smugglers.

The gate to the old city was at the base of the hill where the channel had been. It was an archway over a small limestone plaza. At the top of the arch there were two faces, carved on either side of the keystone of the arch. The face welcoming visitors was supposedly a "happy and welcoming" Christian face. The face that people leaving saw was a barbarian and was to warn people leaving that they were exiting Christendom. 

Rovinj had colorful Venetian style buildings and narrow winding limestone streets. Goran said that all the going up lead to the church, going down - to the city gate. Any street that went horizontally would connect to one of the three main vertical arteries. He assured us it would be impossible to get lost - he was correct.

The streets were charming, steep and slippery, and full of little shops. Goran pointed out several choice spots for gelato. We made it to the top of the hill, and as promised there was a church. We were going to go in, but there was a wedding happening which was odd as it was a weekday morning. The courtyard around the church had several large limestone paving stones with words engraved on them. Goran said that wealthy families used to be buried just outside the church, and that these were grave markers. Goran left us at the church. We set off to explore on our own.

We spent the afternoon going up and down and up and down the streets. Most of the building in the center of the old city housed shops offering touristy trinkets - keychains, magnets, rubber ducks dressed like the statue of liberty. While toward the periphery there were more stone residential buildings. I think most of these were now short term rentals.

We ate a late lunch at a small restaurant Kari and Truman had chicken and chicken fingers, Grant had calamari while I had seafood pizza. Over lunch I told Kari about "Croatia's Next Top Dracula", and she laughed so hard it baffled our kids. The bathroom of was up a set of ships stairs, reminiscent of dutch houses we saw in Amsterdam. While in I was in the bathroom, the waiter told Kari he could tell that we were not Americans. We took this as a compliment, as I think it was intended.

An unexpected find were narrow stairwells between buildings that dead-ended at the water. These were great places to sit and look out. We found a couple of these between the buildings Goran had pointed out as smugglers hubs. One such staircase led to a wine shop that had its smugglers doors open along the wall of the shop.

In the evening we returned to San Tomasso, and had a wonderful dinner. The waitress introduced Truman to the house cat, and gave him treats to feed to it. Back in the tiny room, I believe everyone had an incident with the faucet in the washroom. It was very fancy, but was clearly a form-over-function piece of hardware. After the messes were cleared, everyone went to sleep.

### Day 5
Day 5 started off with Kari attempting to take the boys for an early morning swim. Swimming in hotel pools is a bit of a tradition on all of our trips, and as this was to be the last time in a hotel on this trip, they decided to make an attempt. The pool was beautiful, but cold. Too cold for the other guests, but Grant and Truman each eventually made their way in. Breakfast was another fabulous miniature buffet just for us. We were in a bit of a rush as we were leaving immediately after breakfast. The staff was so gracious and offered to pack up some muffins they had made, so we could eat on our long van ride to Split.

#### Plitvice Lakes National Park

To break up the five-hour trip to Split we stopped at for a guided tour of the Plitvice Lakes national park. The park has several large lakes connected by various waterfalls. Mikeala our guide told us that it that the lakes were a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and that swimming was not allowed as the sunscreen and skin care products can throw off the delicate ph balance of the lakes. We took a boat along the biggest lake we would encounter to a landing spot near a waterfall, and wooden walk way leading down. Mikeala explained that the lakes had at one time been a set of larger lake but that the accumulation of _Tufa_ built up and created divisions between the bodies of water. Tufa is like travertine, but the conditions to create it were different, and that these lakes were the best environment in the world for it to form.

The lakes were in a large and lush ravine with high stone sides. The wooden walk way snaked along the edge of the rock-face. Water often visibly rushing a few centimeters beneath the slats. The lakes are terraced and we were making our way down. When the water was still it was clear and azure blue, we could often see little fishes at the waters still edges. As we moved down, each lake was separated by picturesque waterfalls, created by the tufa. Each lake had its own name, and usually came from a local legend. The park was crowded, and the pathway was about as wide as a sidewalk and had no railing in most parts. The path had been paid for by a donation from a famous opera singer in the early 1900s, and looked like it was at least one hundred years old, although Mikeala said that each plank was replaced every couple of years, and great pains are taken to match the type of wood, and size of the plank. It was a full-time job to ensure the boys didn't step off into the water. They were both impressed with the waterfalls, lakes and fishes.

The last stop on the tour was the Big Waterfall. The name while unoriginal, was accurate, but did not convey the majesty of the water fall. Dozens of streams cascaded their way down the 80m cliff, bouncing off of outcroppings of rock and tufa, splitting and racing their way to a large pool. We stood and watched for a wile, and were sure to take pictures. The place was full of students from the region on a field trips. We climbed up a trail opposite the big water fall, it reminded me of the trails leading to the suspended bridges in Costa Rica, except we had a continuous view of the water fall.
