# Vacation on the Adriatic Sea

On Friday May 16th we embarked on a family trip to Italy and Croatia. This is a trip Kari and I had been mulling over since before the boys were born. The plan: To fly to Venice - spend a few days there, then take a ferry across the Adriatic to Croatia, and spend a week on the Dalmatian coast.

The flight was delayed and long, but direct from Toronto to Venice. We sat two by two Kari with Grant, myself and Truman the row behind them. We were fortunate that we all got some sleep.

## Venice

We arrived in Venice around noon local time, and were greeted by an older Italian woman with a placard with Kari's name on it. We hopped in a large black van and headed from Marco Polo airport across the Constitution bridge to the edge of the city. The sun was high and the sky clear, it was warm. We soaked up the sunshine while we waited for the first of many boats on the trip - a water taxi to The Saturnia - our hotel while in Venice.

We took the taxi through the canals of Venice, passing gondolas full of tourists, under low foot bridges, and past all manner of Italian style buildings all bordered with salt stains for high waters past. We took the grand canal for a while and past water busses and speed boats, before turning down another small canal on which our hotel had an entrance.

We met our concierge at the hotel, a Venetian local, who marked several points of interest on a map, and gave us our room key. The key was a card, and a physical key all on a long thin metal key chain that looked like a miniature abacus. Our room was a large suite on the second floor. It had a queen bed on the ground level, two bathrooms a mezzanine with two twin beds for the boys. After settling in we decided to explore the city, and look for gelato and maybe food.

We wandered the city looking for some lunch. We were unable to follow the markings the concierge had left on our map, but found a sandwich shop. The concierge gave us a useful tip for wayfinding - Look up and there will be signs with arrows labled 'Rialto', 'Accadamia', or 'San Marco'. Using this system we wandered through the narrow streets of stuccoed buildings to Sait Marks Square. The square was very impressive, full of people and pigeons. The boys had room to run around, and we were able slowly make our way from an arcade on one side of the square to the other where the Basilica, Doge's Palace, and Saint Marks Tower could be found.

The arcades around the square were full of restaurants and high-end shops, and exits to various side streets. After marveling at the square we decided to follow the Rialto signs. 

The Rialto bridge was quite the sight. Lined with businesses on either side (there was a tie shop, who buys a silk tie from a tourist trap on a bridge?), spanning the grand canal, full of aspiring Instagram models fighting for space for the perfect shot. At the apex of the bridge there is a gap in the shops on either side, where you can see out. We were treated to terrific views of the grand canal from both sides of the bridge.

We crossed the bridge, ate gelato, had "Take-away" Aperol spritzes and listened to a street performer before continuing our exploration. The city was beautiful, and reminded me of Florence, but with more tourist nick-knack stores - I didn't think that was possible. Everywhere we went the predominant language I heard was English and I could not help feeling bad for the Venetians. They had been a prominent force in global trade and the preeminent naval operation in the Adriatic. The unique properties of the city that had enabled it to become prosperous were a hindrance when the world changed. Now the only business that seemed to exist was parading the city's unique features out for hordes of visitors. Once a regional superpower, now a curiosity to be observed like a freak show at the county fair.

We ate dinner along alfresco along a canal. We met a couple of other Canadians at the restaurant. They were from the west coast, and we talked about the NHL playoffs among other things. The food was _ok_, and very expensive - a description that could fit most of the meals we ate in Venice. Grant was pooped on by either a seagull or a pigeon. Either way he was not happy.
